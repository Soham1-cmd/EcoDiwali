        <ul>
            <li>Use biodegradable items like natural flowers and organic materials that do not harm the environment when immersed. 🌸</li>

            <li>Organize flower composting drives where flowers used in rituals are collected and converted into compost instead of being immersed in water. ♻️</li>
        </ul>
